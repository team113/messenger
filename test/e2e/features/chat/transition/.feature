Feature: Chat transitions

  Scenario: Chats transitions works correctly
    Given user Alice
    And Alice has "Thoughts" group

    # Send the message from the Alice to ensure nothing is cached, when we sign
    # in as Alice, or otherwise the pagination will use the cached items.
    And Alice sends "How are you?" message to "Thoughts" group
    And Alice sends 100 messages to "Thoughts" group
    And Alice replies to "How are you?" message with "I am fine" text in "Thoughts" group
    And Alice reads all messages in "Thoughts" group

    When I sign in as Alice
    And I am in "Thoughts" group
    And I tap `CloseButton` button
    And I tap "How are you?" reply of "I am fine" message
    Then I see "How are you?" message
