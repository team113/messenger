  Scenario: Contacts pagination works correctly
    Given user Alice
    And Alice has 16 contacts
    And I sign in as Alice

    When I tap `CloseButton` button
    And I tap `ContactsButton` button
    Then I wait until `ContactsTab` is present
    And I see 15 contacts

    Given I have Internet with delay of 3 seconds
    When I scroll `Contacts` until `ContactsLoading` is present
