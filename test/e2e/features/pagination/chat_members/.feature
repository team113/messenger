Feature: Chat members pagination

  Scenario: Chat members pagination works correctly
    Given user Alice
    And Alice has "Members" group with 16 members
    And I sign in as Alice
    And I am in "Members" group

    When I tap `ProceedButton` button
    And I open chat's info
    Then I see 15 chat members

    Given I have Internet with delay of 3 seconds
    When I scroll `ChatInfoScrollable` until `ChatMembers` is present
    And I scroll `ChatMembers` until `MembersLoading` is present
    Then I wait until `MembersLoading` is absent
    And I see 16 chat members
