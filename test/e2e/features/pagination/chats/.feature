Feature: Chats pagination

  Scenario: Chats pagination works correctly
    Given user Alice
    And Alice has 31 groups
    And I sign in as Alice

    When I tap `CloseButton` button
    Then I wait until `Chats` is present

    Given I have Internet with delay of 3 seconds
    When I scroll `Chats` until `ChatsLoading` is present
    Then I wait until `ChatsLoading` is absent
