Feature: Blocklist pagination

  Scenario: Blocklist pagination works correctly
    Given user Alice
    And Alice has 16 blocked users
    And I sign in as Alice
    And I wait until `HomeView` is present

    When I scroll `IntroductionScrollable` until `ProceedButton` is present
    And I tap `ProceedButton` button
    And I tap `MenuButton` button
    And I scroll `MenuListView` until `Blocklist` is present
    And I tap `Blocklist` button
    And I tap `ShowBlocklist` button
    Then I wait until `BlocklistView` is present
    And I see 15 blocked users

    Given I have Internet with delay of 3 seconds
    When I scroll `BlocklistView` to bottom
    Then I wait until `BlocklistLoading` is present
    Then I wait until `BlocklistLoading` is absent
    And I see 16 blocked users
