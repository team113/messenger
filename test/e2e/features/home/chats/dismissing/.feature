Feature: Chats dismissing

  Scenario: Chats can be dismissed and restored
    Given I am Alice
    And I have "01" group
    And I have "02" group
    And I wait until "01" chat is present
    And I wait until "02" chat is present
    And I see no chats dismissed
    And I wait for app to settle

    When I dismiss "01" chat
    Then I wait until "01" chat is absent
    And I see "01" chat as dismissed

    When I tap `Restore` button
    Then I wait until "01" chat is present

    When I dismiss "02" chat
    Then I wait until "02" chat is absent
    And I see "02" chat as dismissed

    When I dismiss "01" chat
    Then I wait until "01" chat is absent
    And I see "01" chat as dismissed
    And "02" chat is indeed hidden

    When I pause for 6 seconds
    Then I see no chats dismissed
    And "01" chat is indeed hidden
