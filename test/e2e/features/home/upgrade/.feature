Feature: Upgrade popup

  Scenario: Versions prompted in upgrade popups can be skipped
    Given appcast with newer version is available

    When I wait for app to settle
    Then I wait until `UpgradePopup` is present

    When I tap `SkipButton` button
    Then I wait until `UpgradePopup` is absent

    When I restart app
    And I wait for 5 seconds
    Then I wait until `UpgradePopup` is absent

  Scenario: Upgrade popups aren't displayed for current version
    Given appcast with current version is available

    When I wait for app to settle
    And I wait for 5 seconds
    Then I wait until `UpgradePopup` is absent

  Scenario: Critical upgrade popup can't be skipped
    Given appcast with critical version is available

    When I wait for app to settle
    Then I wait until `UpgradePopup` is present
    And I wait until `SkipButton` is absent
