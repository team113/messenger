Feature: Connection status

  @home
  Scenario: Connection status is properly displayed
    Given I am Alice
    And I wait for app to settle

    When I do not have Internet
    Then I wait until `NotConnected` is present

    When I have Internet without delay
    Then I wait until `Connected` is present
    And I pause for 10 seconds
