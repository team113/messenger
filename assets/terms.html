    <strong>Terms &amp; Conditions</strong>
    <p>These terms and conditions applies to the Gapopa app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices
        that
        was created by IT ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT INC (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as an Open Source
        service.
    </p>
    <p>Upon downloading or utilizing the Application, you are automatically agreeing to the following terms. It is
        strongly advised that you thoroughly read and understand these terms prior to using the Application.</p>
    <p>The Service Provider is dedicated to ensuring that the Application is as beneficial and efficient as possible. As
        such, they reserve the right to modify the Application or charge for their services at any time and for any
        reason.
        The Service Provider assures you that any charges for the Application or its services will be clearly
        communicated
        to you.</p>
    <p>The Application stores and processes personal data that you have provided to the Service Provider in order to
        provide the Service. It is your responsibility to maintain the security of your phone and access to the
        Application.
        The Service Provider strongly advise against jailbreaking or rooting your phone, which involves removing
        software
        restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. Such actions could expose
        your
        phone to malware, viruses, malicious programs, compromise your phone's security features, and may result in the
        Application not functioning correctly or at all.</p>

    <div>
        <p>Please note that the Application utilizes third-party services that have their own Terms and Conditions.
            Below
            are the links to the Terms and Conditions of the third-party service providers used by the Application:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play
                    Services</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://sentry.io/terms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sentry</a></li>
        </ul>
    </div>


    <p>Please be aware that the Service Provider does not assume responsibility for certain aspects. Some functions of
        the
        Application require an active internet connection, which can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network
        provider.
        The Service Provider cannot be held responsible if the Application does not function at full capacity due to
        lack of
        access to Wi-Fi or if you have exhausted your data allowance.</p>


    <p>If you are using the application outside of a Wi-Fi area, please be aware that your mobile network provider's
        agreement terms still apply. Consequently, you may incur charges from your mobile provider for data usage during
        the
        connection to the application, or other third-party charges. By using the application, you accept responsibility
        for
        any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the application outside of your home territory
        (i.e.,
        region or country) without disabling data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you are
        using the application, they assume that you have obtained permission from the bill payer.</p>


    <p>Similarly, the Service Provider cannot always assume responsibility for your usage of the application. For
        instance, it is your responsibility to ensure that your device remains charged. If your device runs out of
        battery
        and you are unable to access the Service, the Service Provider cannot be held responsible.</p>


    <p>In terms of the Service Provider's responsibility for your use of the application, it is important to note that
        while they strive to ensure that it is updated and accurate at all times, they do rely on third parties to
        provide
        information to them so that they can make it available to you. The Service Provider accepts no liability for any
        loss, direct or indirect, that you experience as a result of relying entirely on this functionality of the
        application.</p>


    <p>The Service Provider may wish to update the application at some point. The application is currently available as
        per the requirements for the operating system (and for any additional systems they decide to extend the
        availability
        of the application to) may change, and you will need to download the updates if you want to continue using the
        application. The Service Provider does not guarantee that it will always update the application so that it is
        relevant to you and/or compatible with the particular operating system version installed on your device.
        However,
        you agree to always accept updates to the application when offered to you. The Service Provider may also wish to
        cease providing the application and may terminate its use at any time without providing termination notice to
        you.
        Unless they inform you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these
        terms
        will end; (b) you must cease using the application, and (if necessary) delete it from your device.</p>

    <strong>Changes to These Terms and Conditions</strong>
    <p>The Service Provider may periodically update their Terms and Conditions. Therefore, you are advised to review
        this
        page regularly for any changes. The Service Provider will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and
        Conditions on this page.</p>
    <p>These terms and conditions are effective as of 2024-04-11</p>

    <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about the Terms and Conditions, please do not hesitate to contact the
