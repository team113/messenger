  ///   Examples: "19700101", "-0004-12-24", "81030-04-01".
  /// * An optional time part, separated from the date by either `T` or a space.
  ///   The time part is a two digit hour,
  ///   then optionally a two digit minutes value,
  ///   then optionally a two digit seconds value, and
  ///   then optionally a '.' or ',' followed by at least a one digit
  ///   second fraction.
  ///   The minutes and seconds may be separated from the previous parts by a
  ///   ':'.
  ///   Examples: "12", "12:30:24.124", "12:30:24,124", "123010.50".
  /// * An optional time-zone offset part,
  ///   possibly separated from the previous by a space.
  ///   The time zone is either 'z' or 'Z', or it is a signed two digit hour
  ///   part and an optional two digit minute part. The sign must be either
  ///   "+" or "-", and cannot be omitted.
  ///   The minutes may be separated from the hours by a ':'.
  ///   Examples: "Z", "-10", "+01:30", "+1130".
  ///
  /// This includes the output of [toString], which will be parsed back into a
  /// [PreciseDateTime] object with the same time as the original.
  ///
  /// The result is always in either local time or UTC. If a time zone offset
  /// other than UTC is specified, the time is converted to the equivalent UTC
  /// time.
  ///
  /// Examples of accepted strings:
  ///
  /// * `"2012-02-27"`
  /// * `"2012-02-27 13:27:00"`
  /// * `"2012-02-27 13:27:00.123456789z"`
  /// * `"2012-02-27 13:27:00,123456789z"`
  /// * `"20120227 13:27:00"`
  /// * `"20120227T132700"`
  /// * `"20120227"`
  /// * `"+20120227"`
  /// * `"2012-02-27T14Z"`
  /// * `"2012-02-27T14+00:00"`
  /// * `"-123450101 00:00:00 Z"`: in the year -12345.
